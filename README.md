### Description:
For my CS50 final project, I have created a website called "Islamic Prayers for All." The website compiles the most common Islamic prayers with
English translations and transliterations to help those who struggle with the Arabic language.
### How Does the Website Work?
Islamic Prayers for All is extremely easy to use. Users only need to click on the name of page they would like to access, and they’ll be redirected to it.
Users can also access transliterations of the Arabic prayers either by clicking on each “Transliterate” button accompanying certain Arabic prayers
or by clicking on the “Transliterate All Arabic Text” button which will transliterate all the Arabic prayers accompanied by “Transliterate” buttons.
However, for some Arabic prayers, users will notice that these prayers are not accompanied by “Transliterate” buttons because only
transliterated versions of the prayers are provided. That is the case because these prayers are verses of the Quran and that's how they should be read or recited.
Users can also go to the “Bibliography” page, where they can download the main books and access the main websites that I used to compile all the prayers,
translations, and transliterations provided in this website.
### Project Files:
All of the HTML files in my project, except "index.html" and "bibliography.html," include their own JavaScript files.
These HTML files (through HTML and JavaScript code) display Arabic prayers along with their English translations and transliterations.
Certain Arabic prayers are only provided with their English transliterations, for these prayers are verses of the Quran and that's how
they should be read or recited. For the Arabic prayers that are provided with both their English translations and transliterations, I have
decided to display the Arabic prayers and their translations in separate panels for better readability. As for the transliteration, I have decided
that it would be best for the user to choose whether or not he or she wants to view that transliteration. The user has the freedom to either not transliterate
any Arabic prayers in a page or transliterate some or all Arabic prayers in a page through the buttons provided in the page.

The "index.html" file simply displays to the user (through HTML code) an explanation of what this website is and why does one recite the Islamic prayers.
As for the "bibliography.html" page, it displays to the user (through HTML code) the main sources from which I have compiled the prayers, translations,
and transliterations provided in this website. I decided that a bibliography page would be important for the users to ensure the authenticity
of the prayers I compiled.

I have also used CSS for all the HTML files to ensure that the HTML codes’ contents will be presented in a neat, readable way.
I also limited the color scheme in my website so that the contents of a page are easy to read and so that the users will get used to the style of the website. 
### Credits:
This project is a one-person project created by Sohaila. I was mainly able to create this website using the knowledge I have garnered from
"CS50’s Introduction to Computer Science" course. If you have noticed any bug in this website, please notify me so that I fix it.
