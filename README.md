#### Description:
For my CS50 final project, I have created a website called "Islamic Prayers for All." The website compiles the most common Islamic prayers with English translations and transliterations to help whoever struggles with the Arabic language.
All of the HTML files in my project, except "index.html" and "bibliography.html," include their own JavaScript files. These HTML files (through HTML and JavaScript code) display Arabic prayers along with their English translations and transliterations. Certain Arabic prayers are only provided with their English transliterations, for these prayers are verses of the Qur'an and that's how they should be read or recited.
For the Arabic prayers that are provided with both their English translations and transliterations, I have decided to display the Arabic prayers and their translations in separate panels for better readability. As for the transliteration, I have decided that it would be best for the user to choose whether or not he or she wants to view that transliteration.
The user has the freedom to either not transliterate any Arabic prayers in a page or transliterate some or all Arabic prayers in a page through the buttons provided in the page.

The "index.html" file simply displays to the user (through HTML code) an explanation of what this website is and why does one recite the Islamic prayers. As for the "bibliography.html" page, it displays to the user (through HTML code) the main sources from which I have compiled the prayers, translations, and transliterations provided in this website.
I decided that a bibliography page would be important for the users to ensure the authenticity of the prayers I compiled.
